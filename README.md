# atmega16m1-breakout
Breakout for the ATMega16M1 / ATMega32M1 / ATMega64M1 in the TQFP package.

Has 16 MHz crystal and CAN transceiver... because why else would you use the ATMega16m1?!

You can order it directly from OSH Park if you want, [here's the link](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/IkiqLfbC).
